## About CTTTN

This network and web platform were born out of the growing scientific, professional and public interest in the use of translation technologies for creative texts, which has led to the release of position statements from various associations, articles in mainstream media outlets, and accounts of technology use by both translators and publishers. In this context, it is auspicable for specialists in translation and technology to join forces and provide a reasoned response to this challenge. Issues to be explored include the evaluation of these tools and workflows for creative translation tasks while accounting for relevant ethical, social and economic factors, as well as the development of a sustainable and responsible framework for technological advancement in the field.

This network aims at assessing the convergence and divergence points between human and artificial translation; between the socio-technological realities of translators and the challenges of the industry and publishing world; between the steady improvement of applications such as neural machine translation and the overoptimistic views or fears tied to generative artificial intelligence; and between the technological advances and ergonomic aspects of translation tools. More specific points of interest include the effects of these systems on the translation and creative processes, on the reception of creative content and reader engagement, on language and style, as well as on the cultural production and transfer as a whole. In the medium term, this network will focus on the development of training materials, with the hope of empowering translators, informing the general public, sharing best practices for teaching, research and software engineering, and fostering connections with relevant stakeholders and other research field by acting as a contact point.

Similarly, this platform aims to give more visibility to research, translators and their work, while also promoting a more inclusive and user-centred approach to the development of translation technology.
