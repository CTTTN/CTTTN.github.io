## Workshop on Translation Technology for Creative Domains
### 3 July 2022 &ndash; Rhodes, Greece

This workshop is organised as an accompanying event of NeTTT 2022. The primary aim of the workshop is to ascertain the current state of the art of research on translation technologies in the creative domain. As part of this aim, the workshop will ask about recent developments in the technology itself, as well as in the attitudes of translators working in the creative domain towards translation technology and their experience with it.

## Computer-Assisted Literary Translation Conference
### 11&ndash;13 May 2021 &ndash; Swansea, UK

Literary translators tend to resist using the systems which dominate the lives of most other professional translators: CAT tools, translation memories (TM), termbases, and machine translation systems (MT). However, in the last five years developments have taken place which suggest that there are pluses as well as minuses for literary translators in the use of different kinds of computer-assisted translation. These include CAT tools, corpus linguistics, natural language processing, text analysis and visualisation and in particular Neural Machine Translation (NMT). The conference will explore some of these developments and their actual and potential impact on literary translators and readers from both theoretical and empirical standpoints, with an emphasis on applications and illustrative case studies.
